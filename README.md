# ci-comparison

This is an experiment to compare the run times of a few different CI strategies.
It will be accompanied by a blog post that needs the comparison.

The files were initialized from my [templates](https://github.com/justinrubek/templates): `nix flake new --template ./templates#rust-crane ./ci-comparison`.
